# A mobile is located 5 km away from a base station and uses a vertical Î» /4 monopole antenna with a gain of 2.55 dB to receive cellular 3 radio signals. The E-field at 1 km from the transmitter is measured to be V/rn. The carrier frequency used for this system is  900 MHz. (a) Find the length and the gain of the receiving antenna. (b) Find the received power at the mobile using the 2-ray ground reflection model assuming the height of the transmitting antenna is 50 m and the receiving antenna is 1.5m above ground.

# Given values
T_R_distance = 5  # Distance between transmitter and receiver in km
E_field = 1e-3  # Electric field in V/m
f = 900  # Frequency in MHz
d0 = 1000  # Distance for electric field measurement in meters
c = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s

# Converting frequency to Hz
f *= 1e6

# Calculating wavelength
lamda = c / f

# Height of transmitting and receiving antennas
ht = 50  # in meters
hr = 1.5  # in meters

# Distance from transmitter to receiver
d = T_R_distance * 1000  # in meters
