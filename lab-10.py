#  A hexagonal cell within a 4-cell system has a radius of 1.387 km. A total of 60 channels 
# are used within the entire system. If the load per user is 0.029 Erlangs, and Î»= call/hour, 
# compute the following for an Erlang C system that has a 5% probability of a delayed call: 
# (a) How many users per square kilometer will this system support? 
# (b) What is the probability that a delayed call will have to wait for more than 10s? 
# (c) What is the probability that a call will be delayed for more than 10 seconds?
